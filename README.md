## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

+ some extra stuff I'm planning to add: editing todos, marking for priority

### What I learned


### Continued development


### Useful resources

- [Unique ID generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) - For setting unique todo IDs (slight improvement from Math.random ^^)
- [useLocalStorage React hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-local-storage) - Simplifies using LocalStorage (I used it for storing theme settings and todos)

- [Easy Dark Mode Setup in React](https://css-tricks.com/easy-dark-mode-and-multiple-color-themes-in-react/) - Using the above mentioned LocalStorage hook
